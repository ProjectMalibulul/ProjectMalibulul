# 🌊 Malibulul Collective Front Page

This is the official, AI-augmented portal for the **Malibulul** organization. It showcases our team, our "Small Scale, Big Impact" philosophy, and dynamic insights generated by Google Gemini.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Pushing to GitHub

To make this usable for your organization, follow these steps:

1.  **Create the Repository:**
    Go to GitHub and create a new repository under `ProjectMalibulul` named `portfolio` (or `ProjectMalibulul` to make it your profile landing page).

2.  **Initialize and Push:**
    ```bash
    # Initialize the local directory
    git init

    # Add your files
    git add .

    # Commit the changes
    git commit -m "feat: initial release of fancy front page"

    # Link to your organization repo
    git remote add origin https://github.com/ProjectMalibulul/portfolio.git

    # Push to the main branch
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## 🌐 Making it Live (GitHub Pages)

1.  Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Go to **Settings > Pages**.
3.  Under **Build and deployment**, set the source to **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  Select the `main` branch and the `/(root)` folder.
5.  Click **Save**. Your site will be live at `https://projectmalibulul.github.io/portfolio/`.
